# js30
Just keeping track of my progress in the 30 day vanilla js challenge   
Challenge link: https://javascript30.com/

### the why
I've got a lot of time on my hands, so I figured why not try to get better at Javascript? 

### notes (divided by project)
1 - redo project using my own solution (to be figured out later)
