# js30
just keeping track of my progress in the 30 day vanilla js challenge  
start date: june 25/2021  
challenge link: https://javascript30.com/

### üå±the why
i've got a lot of time on my hands, so i figured why not try to get better at Javascript

### ‚úènotes (divided by project)
1 - redo project using my own solution (to be figured out later)  
2 - solve the 360deg issue (when clock hand reaches 360deg, issue happens)  
3 - redo project using my own solution (to be figured out later)  

### üí°thoughts
- really plan your time well.  or maybe that's just because i take forever to design, code then troubleshoot problems...
- it's alright to code along with the video (personally am not used to 1 day time constraints), although i'm still going to create my own solution to the problem later
- it's also okay to take longer than the 1 day constraint, as long as you learn something/finish the project (yes, i took two days to finish the day 1 project...)
