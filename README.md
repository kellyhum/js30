# js30
just keeping track of my progress in the 30 day vanilla js challenge  
start date: june 25/2021  
challenge link: https://javascript30.com/

### üå±the why
i've got a lot of time on my hands, so i figured i'd use it to improve my js skills  
  
### ‚úènotes (divided by project)
**if you see "redo project/solution" that means i was busy so i followed the video instructions  

1 - redo project/solution  
2 - solve the 360deg issue (when clock hand reaches 360deg, issue happens)    
3 - redo project/solution  
5 - redo project/solution  

### üí°thoughts
- really plan your time well.  or maybe that's just because i take forever to design, code then troubleshoot problems...
- it's alright to code along with the video (personally am not used to 1 day time constraints), although i'm still going to create my own solution to the problem later
- it's also okay to take longer than the 1 day constraint, as long as you learn something/finish the project (because yes, it does take me 6 hours just to understand a single concept...)
